# OpenAI ReportGenie: QBee

A web application that utilizes OpenAI's text generation capabilities to provide recommendations for fields to include in reports based on given report names, descriptions, and available fields.

The backend of the application is built using Express.js, a Node.js web application framework, and it communicates with the OpenAI API to generate text recommendations. The frontend is built using Next.js, a React framework for building server-side rendered web applications. Users interact with the application through a web interface where they can input report names, descriptions, and available fields, and then receive recommendations generated by the OpenAI API.

The project includes default prompts for generating recommendations, which can be adjusted based on specific requirements. It also provides error handling logic for dealing with issues such as invalid inputs or errors from the OpenAI API.

Overall, the project aims to streamline the process of generating reports by leveraging AI-powered text generation to provide helpful recommendations for field selection.

### Setup

1. If you donâ€™t have Node.js installed, [install it from here](https://nodejs.org/en/) (Node.js version >= 14.6.0 required)

2. Clone this repository

3. Navigate into the project directory

   ```bash
   $ cd openai-quickstart-node
   ```

4. Install the requirements

   ```bash
   $ npm install
   ```

5. Make a copy of the example environment variables file

   On Linux systems: 
   ```bash
   $ cp .env.example .env
   ```
   On Windows:
   ```powershell
   $ copy .env.example .env
   ```
6. Add your [API key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) to the newly created `.env` file

7. Run the app

   ```bash
   $ npm run dev
   ```

You should now be able to access the app at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)! For the full context behind this example app, check out the [tutorial](https://platform.openai.com/docs/quickstart).

### Endpoints
